You go back to sleep and dream of school anyways. Only this time you are tall and brolic :D As you walk on campus everyone breaks their neck to see you pass. All the girls want you for themselves and all the boys want to be you! Then as you walk into class you realize your mother was the teacher. She stares into your soul and screams “WAKE UP!!!”. You then wake up back in your pathetic scrawny body. You sit up and put on your glasses. You check your phone for notifications and see you have one new message from your close friend Ron as well as one email from your teacher.


[You check the message from your friend Ron and it read “Hey buddy, I will be at your house in 5 minutes get ready!”](message.md)

[You check the email from your teacher and it says “You have been marked absent too often to the point you are no longer eligible to pass the class"](email.md)
