You crawl out of bed and drag yourself to the bathroom to take a quick shower. But that quick shower turns into a 20 minutes shower...oops. When you finally get dress and grab your bag you are faced with a pissed off Ron sitting on your couch. You try to cheer him up by telling him that after school you two will spend it playing Clash of Royales non-stop, but that does nothing. Ron tells you this is the third time this week that you are late and that you still haven’t done your half of the project for class. In his anger he storms out the house upset that you are unreliable...yet AGAIN! Trying to avoid you and ends up getting hit by a bus…
