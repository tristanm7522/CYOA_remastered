You decide to ignore the message from Ron and read the email from your History teacher. He informs you that you have been "skipping" class too often that you are not able to pass the course for the semester. In a panic you start thinking what your parents are going to think...or worst do! You could either face the wrath or beg him to give you a second chance.
