You can hear all the humiliation behind you and feel bad for Ron but think inside hey.. at least it ain't me :P

On the next stop a girl comes on the bus and your eyes meet. Her eyes are a shade of blue mixed with grey. You stare into them and she smiles at you happily. You realize your staring and blush. She decides to sit next to you. You freak out CX She talks to you before you reach campus. She says "Hey.. your Marco right?", you nod your head. Smiling, the girl introduces herself "My name is Jackie." Walking off the bus she asks you, "Do you wanna see something special?"
