You rush to your friends aid. Justin says "Back off nerd! Unless you want some too?" Marco replies, "Common Justin give him a bre.." Justin goes to punch you but the bus starts to move and he trips on the floor landing head firston the floor. He picks himself up and you see he has a gash in his head and blood runs down his face. Covering his face he walks away to the front and doesn't say a word. The bus stops and you watch Justin as he steps off the bus and a girl enters the bus and your eyes meet. Her eyes are a shade of blue mixed with grey. You stare into them and she smiles. You realize your staring and blush. Ron exclaims "MY HERO! Oh man the away you just swooped in and got me out of that situation? I owe you dude."
